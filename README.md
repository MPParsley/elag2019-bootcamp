## Abstract

From LOD to LOUD: making data usable

Linked Open Usable Data (LOUD) extends Linked Open Data (LOD) by focussing on use cases, being as simple as possible, and providing developer friendly web APIs with JSON-LD. The term was coined [by Rob Sanderson](https://www.slideshare.net/azaroth42/europeanatech-keynote-shout-it-out-loud). [This workshop](http://swib.org/swib18/programme.html#abs03) will introduce you to the basic concepts of LOUD, web APIs, and JSON-LD. You'll learn how to publish and document data as LOUD, and how to use that data in different contexts.

In this workshop, we will:

- Convert RDF data into usable [JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org/)
- Index and query the data with [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch)
- Create a simple web application using the data
- Visualize the data with [Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana)
- Document the data with [Hypothesis annotations](https://web.hypothes.is/)
- Use the data with [OpenRefine](http://openrefine.org/)

Audience: librarians and developers working with linked open data.

Requirements: Laptop with [Elasticsearch 6.x](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/_installation.html), [OpenRefine 2.8](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/Installation-Instructions), a text editor, web browser, and a command line with [cURL](https://curl.haxx.se/download.html) and [jsonld.js via node.js](https://github.com/digitalbazaar/jsonld.js#installation). As an alternative, we'll also provide a fully configured virtual machine to workshop participants.

## Location

The LOUD workshop will take place on the premises of the [German Institute for Adult Education](https://www.die-bonn.de/default.aspx?lang=en) (Deutsches Institut für Erwachsenenbildung, short: DIE :-). The workshop room is on the ground floor and easy to find. You will have to show your passport at the gate. (This security measures apply because there are other federal authorities located on the premises.) Here is a map showing the five-minute walk from the registration desk at Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung (green marker) to the gate (red marker):

## Setup

There are three options:

1. [Install all tools locally into your own operating system (OS)](#local-installation)
2. [Install _VirtualBox_ and use the virtual machine we provide](#virtualbox)
3. For the command-line exercises (part I and II): [Use docker](#docker) (thanks [@EnnoMeijers](https://github.com/EnnoMeijers))

### Local installation

With sample commands for Debian-based Linux systems, follow links for others.

#### Basic tools

Install [git](https://git-scm.com/):

`apt install git`

Install [cURL](https://curl.haxx.se/download.html):

`apt install curl`

Install [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/):

`apt install jq`

#### Node.js

Install [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (8.x or higher):

`curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_8.x | sudo -E bash -`

`apt install -y nodejs`

#### jsonld-cli

Install the hbz [jsonld-cli](https://github.com/hbz/jsonld-cli) fork:

`git clone https://github.com/hbz/jsonld-cli.git`

`cd jsonld-cli`

`sudo npm install -g`

For details, see [the setup instructions](https://github.com/hbz/jsonld-cli#installation).

#### Elasticsearch

Install [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/install-elasticsearch.html) 6.x:

`wget -qO - https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch | sudo apt-key add -`

`apt install apt-transport-https`

`echo "deb https://artifacts.elastic.co/packages/6.x/apt stable main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/elastic-6.x.list`

`sudo apt update && sudo apt install elasticsearch`

`sudo -i service elasticsearch start`

Wait a few seconds for Elasticsearch to start up, then open [http://localhost:9200/](http://localhost:9200/) to verify Elasticsearch is running.

#### OpenRefine

See [http://openrefine.org/download.html](http://openrefine.org/download.html)

#### Kibana

Install [Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/kibana):

`sudo apt-get install kibana`

`sudo -i service kibana start`

Wait a few seconds for Kibana to start up, then open [http://localhost:5601](http://localhost:5601) to verify Kibana is running.

### Repository

Clone the repo:

`git clone https://github.com/hbz/swib18-workshop.git`

Go to the repo:

`cd swib18-workshop`

Install dependencies:

`npm install`

Run the server (in `js/app.js`):

`npm start`

This will serve the local context at [http://localhost:3000/context.json](http://localhost:3000/context.json).

### VirtualBox

As an alternative to the manual setup above, we provide a working environment for VirtualBox. VirtualBox is available for all OSes and allows to run a virtual computer in your own OS. The virtual machine provides every tool mentioned under "Local installation", set up as a Linux box.

#### Installation of VirtualBox

See: [https://www.VirtualBox.org/wiki/Downloads](https://www.VirtualBox.org/wiki/Downloads)

Start the box. If it doesn't come up with a GUI you may have to install the "virtualbox-qt" package.

#### Load the virtual machine into VirtualBox

Download the 7z-archived (or zipped) virtual machine from [http://labs.lobid.org/download/](http://labs.lobid.org/download/). The size of the packed file is 2.4 GB (3 GB for the zip), unpacked it's 7.5 GB (so make sure you have got around at least 10 GB free space). To decompress the 7z-archived file you need the [7z archiver](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html).

Installation on Debian-based Linux:

`sudo apt install p7zip`

Unpack:

`7z x swib_2018-Workshop_VBox.7z`

Decompressing takes about 5 minutes, depending on your hardware. To set it up in your VirtualBox:

- Menu -> Machine -> Add...
- Select the Swib_2018-Workshop_LOUD.vbox file

When you are finished, a virtual machine should appear in the VirtualBox. Start the machine. A new window should appear with Ubuntu booting until you see the graphical login manager. If you get a "kernel panic" instead, try to [enable virtualization in your BIOS or EFI](https://www.howtogeek.com/213795/how-to-enable-intel-vt-x-in-your-computers-bios-or-uefi-firmware/).

#### Configs of your virtual machine

The password for the user _I_ is "12345".

*Note*: the keyboard-layout is preconfigured to German. If you want to change this: click on the blue-white icon in the top left corner under "machine", choose "settings" on the right bottom, select "Keyboard" on the left side. Click on the "Layout" tab, unclick the "Use system defaults", "Add" the keyboard layout you need, then push it to first position by selecting that layout and clicking on the arrows. Close the window, you are done.

Normally it's possible to copy 'n' paste between your "normal" OS (aka "host") and the "guest" (the Ubuntu machine). While it's not a mandatory feature it may be handy. If that's not working and you feel you need it: you need to install the ["Guest Additions"](https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch03.html#settings-general-advanced).

### Docker

Install docker-compose:

`apt install docker-compose`

Start the container:

`docker-compose up`

In a new terminal, run a bash in the container:

`docker exec -it swib18workshop_swibws_1 bash`

Here you can run the command-line exercises from part I and II.
